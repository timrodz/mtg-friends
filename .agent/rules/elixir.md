This is an Elixir application using the phoenix framework, and Daisy UI + tailwind for component styling

- When running elixir in the terminal, always "source .env" first to load the environment variables. This command only needs to run once per terminal session.
- When adding new dependencies, run "mix do deps.get, deps.compile"
- Do not delete any tests
